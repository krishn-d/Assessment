Compile time: Compile time is when program compiles. i.e, when Java program is written in Source code
			  the compiler will inspect the program and syntax line by line and convert source code 
			  to byte code.
			  
Runtime: 	  Runtime is when compiled byte code i.e, ".class" file executes in computer or machine.

Ex.: public class Message
	 {
		public static void main{String[] message}
		{
			System.out.println("Welcome");
		}
	 }
Intially when this program is compiled compiler inspects the instructions line by line and if any errors 
are found then compiler shows an error. If not then it will create a byte code named as Message.class.
This is called as Compile time. When Message.class file is executed it shows an output it is called as 
Runtime and during this instructor can pass arguments to the main method.
