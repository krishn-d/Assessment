//Encapsulation: 	Encapsulation is defined as bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to
//					some of an object's components. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class.

//Ex.
public class Encapsulation
{
	private static long phoneNum = 9012345678l;
	public static void main(String[] num)
	{
		System.out.println("Phone Number: " +phoneNum);
	}
}
